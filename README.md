*Abstract*&mdash;This paper describes the four systems RMIT fielded for the TREC
2015 LiveQA task and the associated experiments.  The challenge results show
that the base run RMIT-0 has achieved an above-average performance, but other
attempted improvements have all resulted in decreased retrieval effectiveness.

## Overview ##

In the TREC LiveQA 2015 challenge, we experimented with four different
retrieval-based answer-finding strategies.  Instead of pursuing a traditional
question-answering approach that seeks deeper understanding of the questions,
we focused on simple enhancements, such as summarization, query trimming, and
headword expansion.  These are common techniques used in IR, and can easily be
integrated into research-purpose retrieval engines or pipelines of a similar
scale.  In our experiments, we considered the following research questions: 

<b>RQ 1</b>: *Will shorter or longer summaries result in better answers?*

<b>RQ 2</b>: *Should all of the terms in a question be used, or should only a 
subset of "important" terms be used?*

<b>RQ 3</b>: *Can headword expansion using external resources improve the
quality of answers?*

To answer these questions, we configured four different systems in the 2015
challenge.  Surprisingly, we found that passage retrieval using the full query
with minimal summarization and no query reduction or expansion produced the
best results.

## Data and Retrieval Settings ##

We now describe the collection and retrieval setting used in our system. 

### Server Architecture ###

![](TREC-live-QA.png)

Figure 1.  System architecture for each RMIT system.  Green shading indicates 
components that are different when compared to RMIT-0.

The servers are built on top of the computing resources we allocated from
[NecTAR][a], the Australian National Research cloud computing
network.  Throughout the challenge, we use only one instance to host all of the
services.

Question responses were dependent on the server ID when the questions were
served (see Figure 1).  In the most basic form, the server
converted the questions into a bag-of-words query, and ran these against the
indexes.  The three most relevant passages retrieved are then submitted to our
summarizer component, which outputs a predefined number of sentences ranked by
relevance within the summarizer (see [Summarization](#summarization)).

In our final iteration, we wanted to see if a subset of "important" terms
derived from a headword expansion would improve performance.  In this
iteration, we extracted key terms from the original question, which were then
trimmed.  Query expansion of the headwords was carried out using `word2vec`.
The reduced query with `word2vec` headword expansion is passed to the query
processor.  The retrieved documents were then summarized by the summarizer, and
the first sentence is then returned as the response.

The various services were connected using a resource allocator written in the
Go Programming Language.  It included graceful handling of timeouts, and
guaranteed responses within the 60 second window.  For the curious reader, [our
code][b] is available under a BSD license.  Please cite this paper
if you use the code for anything.

Table 1.  Summary of collections indexed to answer questions.

### Collection ###

Table 1 summarizes the collections we used in the task.  We
indexed AQUAINT and AQUAINT-2 as TREC Text documents.  To prepare the data set
for English Wikipedia, we used the open-source tool
[wp-download][c], to fetch a dump,<sup>[2][]</sup> extracted all of
the XML content using [wikiextractor][d], and indexed every
Wikipedia page as a document.  To index the Yahoo! Answers CQA data, we
processed the collection as follows: rather than just indexing the best
answers, we extracted and indexed only the answers to previous questions and
stored them as documents.  We did not make use of the subject and content tags
(i.e., question title and description) in the data.


### Indexing ###

We used [Indri][e] 5.9 as our retrieval engine with Krovetz stemming and the default
InQuery stoplist.  Once the collection described in the
previous section was indexed, we ended up with a single 39GB index that
contained 38.7 million documents and 12.2 million unique terms.

### Passage Retrieval ###

According to our prior tests over the live stream, the question title contains
10 terms on average, and the body size is around 30 terms.  However, as some of
the question bodies can be quite long, we decided to construct queries using
only the title.  In two of our submitted runs, we tried different ways of
expressing the same query intent by doing query reduction and expansion.  The
details of this approach are described in [Run Descriptions](#run-descriptions).

We used the fixed-sized passage operator
`#combine[passage100:50](...)` provided by Indri to
retrieve and parse the top three passages from document texts.
The result was then sent to the summarizer.
For performance reasons, and the length of some of the queries, we
used a bag-of-words query, and BM25 ranking.
For BM25, our parameter configuration was <i>k<sub>1</sub></i> = 0.9 and <i>b</i> = 0.4.<sup>[3][]</sup> 

### Summarization ###

For summarization, we used the model proposed by [Takamura and Okumura](#takamura2009text)
to generate extractive summaries from the top-ranked
passages.  In this model, summarization is characterized as a two-way
optimization problem, in which coverage over important words is maximized, and
redundancies are minimized simultaneously.  The mathematical formulation is
given as follows:

![](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=%20%20%20%20%5Cbegin%7Bsplit%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%5Ctextrm%7Bmaximize%7D%20%5Cqquad%20%26%20%281-%5Clambda%29%20%5Csum_%7Bj%7D%20w_j%20z_j%20%2B%20%5Clambda%20%5Csum_%7Bi%7D%5Csum_%7Bj%7D%20x_i%20w_j%20a_%7Bij%7D%20%5C%5C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%5Ctextrm%7Bsubject%20to%7D%20%5Cqquad%20%0A%09%20%20%20%26%20x_i%20%5Cin%20%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%20%5Ctextrm%7Bfor%20all%20%24i%24%7D%3B%20%5C%5C%20%0A%09%20%20%20%26%20z_j%20%5Cin%20%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%20%5Ctextrm%7Bfor%20all%20%24j%24%7D%3B%20%5C%5C%0A%09%20%20%20%26%20%5Csum_%7Bi%7D%20c_ix_i%20%5Cle%20K%3B%20%5C%5C%0A%09%20%20%20%26%20%5Csum_%7Bi%7D%5E%7B%7D%20a_%7Bij%7Dx_i%20%5Cge%20z_j%20%5Ctextrm%7Bfor%20all%20%24j%24%7D%20%0A%20%20%20%20%5Cend%7Bsplit%7D%0A&bc=Transparent&fc=Black&im=png&fs=12&ff=cmbright&edit=0)

To produce an extractive summary, one basically makes a choice over the set of
sentences and decides what to include.  By doing so, one also makes an implicit
choice over words.  This choice is modeled in the optimization problem as two
sets of variables <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>z<sub>j</sub></i>, the former indicating the binary decision on
keeping sentence <i>i</i>, and the latter on keeping word <i>j</i> in the summary.  In
other words, for each sentence <i>i</i>, <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> is set to 1 if sentence <i>i</i> is to
be included in the summary, or 0 otherwise.  Analogously for each term <i>j</i>,
<i>z<sub>j</sub></i> is set to 1 if term <i>j</i> is included.

In this problem, <i>c<sub>i</sub></i> denotes the cost of selecting sentence <i>s<sub>i</sub></i> (i.e.
number of characters in <i>s<sub>i</sub></i>), and <i>w<sub>j</sub></i> denotes the weight of word <i>j</i>.  We
used a TF-IDF weighting scheme in which the term frequency (<i>tf</i>) is
derived from the question title and body, and the inverse document-frequency
(<i>idf</i>) is learned from a background corpus.  The term frequency
collected from the question body is further penalized with a factor <i>&alpha;</i> <
1 as the information given in the question body can be less precise than in
the title.

![](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=w_j%20%3D%20%5Cleft%5B%20%5Cvar%7Btf%7D_%7B%5Cvar%7Btitle%7D%7D%28j%29%20%2B%20%5Calpha%20%7E%20%5Cvar%7Btf%7D_%7B%5Cvar%7Bbody%7D%7D%28j%29%20%5Cright%5D%20%2A%20%5Cvar%7Bidf%7D%28j%29&bc=Transparent&fc=Black&im=png&fs=12&ff=cmbright&edit=0)

The correspondence between the sentence <i>i</i> and the word <i>j</i> is coded in the
indicator variable <i>a<sub>ij</sub></i>, whose value is set to 1 if the word <i>j</i> appears
in sentence <i>i</i>, and 0 otherwise.  With the first constraint, we limit the
size of the summary to <i>K</i> characters at most (<i>K</i> is set to 1,000 throughout).
With the second constraint, the word coverage is related to the sentence
coverage, thus completing the formulation.

Empirically, we fine-tuned the parameters <i>&lambda;</i> and <i>&alpha;</i> based on prior
test runs.  In the challenge, we set <i>&lambda;</i> = 0.1 and <i>&alpha;</i> = 0.43.  We
used the IBM CPLEX solver to compute the optimal allocation.


### Headword Detection ###

A *headword* is the key term in the question that helps to retrieve the most
relevant documents.  For example, consider the question: *What are the sales
goals daily and monthly at MAC Cosmetics?*.  Here, the headword is *sales*.
The process of generating the hypernyms is divided into two stages.  To extract
the headword, we generate the syntactic parse tree of the question using the
Stanford parser.  Then, we apply the rule-based model initially defined by
[Collins](#collins2003head) and later refined by [Huang et al.](#huang2008question) 
and [Silva et al.](#silva2011symbolic).


### Query Trimming and Headword Expansion ###

We also experimented with a feature called query trimming, which is to use only
the "important" terms in the question title to retrieve answers.  The
questions from Yahoo! Answers are quite verbose, and intended to be human
readable.  However, verbose queries are known to perform poorly in many
keyword-based IR systems.  So, it seems sensible to use only a subset of terms
from the question, especially if the terms selected are likely to contribute
the most in the ranking function.

First, we used the WAND implementation from Petri et
al. ([2013](#petri2013exploring); [2014](#petri2014score)) to extract the MaxScore <i>U<sub>b</sub></i> for
each term.<sup>[4][]</sup>  The MaxScore list is then loaded into memory when the
server starts.  At query time, we used the list to order terms by impact, and
trim the initial query down to a predefined size.  The size is set to five
terms throughout the experiments where trimming is applied.

We also experimented with two ways of expanding the headword term in each query
externally, by drawing information from resources such as `word2vec` and
`wordnet`:

* `word2vec`: In this method, we took a pre-trained word embedding model
  distributed with [word2vec][f] and used
  [gensim][g] to populate a list of query terms that are most
  similar to a given input.  

* `wordnet`: In this method, we implemented the models proposed by [Huang et
  al.](#huang2008question) and [Silva et al.](#silva2011symbolic).  We extract
  the hypernyms of the head word using WordNet, and map the Penn Treebank POS
  Tags to WordNet tags to decide which part of speech senses should be
  considered.  Then, following the algorithm of [Huang et
  al.](#huang2008question) for head word-sense disambiguation, we calculate
  terms overlap between the definition of each sense and the definition of
  context words (each word in the question excluding the head word) with
  maximum depth of six. The optimal sense (the one which results in the maximum
  number of common words) is chosen to populate the list of synonyms.  

Note that in the latter method, we use the context of the question, excluding
the headword, to resolve the semantic ambiguity of different senses and
populate a list of synonyms.  For example, consider again the question
*What are the sales goals daily and monthly at MAC Cosmetics?*, the
headword is *sales* and the hypernyms are *gross sales*, *income*,
*financial gain*, and *gain sum*.

For either approach, we added the top five generated expansion terms back into
the query without any modification.  Note that when query trimming is applied,
the query would first get trimmed down to 5 terms, and then expanded using the
headword to at most 10 terms totally.

Table 2.  Effectiveness summary for all four RMIT systems when compared to the
average across all systems participating in the 2015 LiveQA track.

The LiveQA challenge results are given in Table 2, where our
submitted runs and the average result across all runs are shown.  Our base run
RMIT-0 delivered the best performance in our experiment, achieving 0.663 in Avg
Score.  The base run outperforms the average across all runs submitted to the
challenge.  On the other hand, all refinements that we tested resulted in
decreased performance, below the average over all submitted runs.

Limiting the output to only the first sentence in the summary (RMIT-1) appears
to have a negative effect on precision at all relevance level.  This is
surprising, since adding more sentences increases the likelihood that
non-relevant information would appear in the summary.

Our result on query trimming and headword expansion also shows no improvement.
Therefore, this combined strategy is not effective when top-sentence precision
is of concern.  Among the two expansion methods, `word2vec` (RMIT-2) appears to
do more harm than `wordnet` (RMIT-3).  We speculated that headword expansion
using `word2vec` is not practically useful, as `word2vec` can be too
aggressive sometimes, generating terms that are not synonyms to the headword
and thus wildly biasing the original intent.

## Conclusion ##

We have explored four different system configurations for the TREC LIVEQA Track
in 2015.  While we are pleasantly surprised with the performance of our
baseline system, we believe further improvements can still be realized using
query reduction and headword expansion.  We hope that further post-run analysis
will provide insight into why the approaches were not successful in our current
system configurations.
